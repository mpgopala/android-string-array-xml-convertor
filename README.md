# android-string-array-xml-convertor

I was doing a small Android project and I had used a lot of String arrays in my code. I wanted a utility to convert all of 
those to string-arrays and put them in resources. When I searched for the same, I did not find any utility to do the same.
This is a simple utility to do exactly the same thing.

Look at the class <code>gsharma.androidutils.stringarraytoxml.AndroidStringArrayXmlConvertor</code> for more details.
